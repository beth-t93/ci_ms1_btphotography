### User Requirements and Expectations
#### Requirements
- Easy to navigate using the menu
- Appealing imagery and design
- Relevant information to accompany the images
- Easy way to contact the photographer
- Clean design that allows the images to be the main attraction to the website

#### Expectations
- The navigation links take you to the page they say they will
- Social media links will open in a separate tab
- When using the contact button all fields will be required before being able to send the message
- Lots of images to showcase the photographers work

## Design Choices
The style of the site will be simple and minimal in order to let the photographs themselves do the work to attract users, however the website will still be accessible and easy to navigate.

### Colors
The colour scheme from this website comes from the photographers work, they make their best work while outside exploring the landscape. The colours will work together in a way that lets the images stand out, while also providing a neutral backdrop to view the photographs on.

![images](docs/features/colour-scheme.jpg)

I have chosen a colour scheme that is neutral with a single pop of colour.
 -Colour 1: (Hex: E8EDDF) is an off white color and will be used for body text, the logo and navigation.
 -Colour 2: (Hex: F5CB5C) is a shad of yellow which will be used in the icon of the logo alongside the off white. It will also be used for headings and call to action buttons
 -Colour 3: (Hex: 242423) is a grey/balck that will be used as the background colour to allow the photographs to be seen true to colour and allow them to stand out from the page.
 -Colour 4: (Hex: 333533) is a lighter grey that will be used to show any layout components, such as the footer, and in the grid components to seperate information into smaller sections.

### Fonts/Typography
To ensure the website is easily readable while also keeping to the simple and minimal design, the fonts used are: Ubuntu for headings and Fira Sans for all other text (these are taken from Google Fonts library) with sans-serif being the fallback font should either of the selected fonts be unavailable. 

### Imagery
All images on the website are taken by myself and are high quality. The images give the viewer a taste of how the photographer works.

## Structure
A four page structured site that uses a combination of images and text.

3. A location map to give users an idea of where the photographer is based.

The page is fully responsive on mobile and tablet.

#### 1 - Image
![images](docs/features/feature-index-image.png)

As this is the first thing a user will see on the site the image needs to be striking and also intrigue the user to make them want to see more of the work.

Like all this images used on the site this image was taken by myself.


#### 2 - About the Photographer
![images](docs/features/feature-index-information.png)

This section was created using a div with paragraph elements for the first part.

For the second part I wanted to make the information easier to read and digest. To do this I used the grid component from Bootstrap to give me three columns wich seperate the information into smaller, more manageable chunks while also being fully responsive for all screen sizes.

#### 3 - Map and location
![images](docs/features/feature-index-map.png)

For this section I again decided to use the grid component to structure the information.

The map is embedded from Google Maps.

9. As a site owner I want to show off my work to demonstrate my skill as a photographer

### Feature 2 - Gallery Page

The gallery contains two main sections;
1. Heading
2. Image gallery

#### 1 - Heading
![images](docs/features/feature-gallery-heading.png)

This part of the page tells the user what the page is and also tells them where to find more information using a hyperlink in the text.

#### 2 - Images
![images](docs/features/feature-gallery-images.png)

This part of the page displays a selection of images using a responsive grid, similar to how the gallery page was structured in the Love Running project from Code Institute.

The grid is responsive so the number og columns in the grid willl decrease.

Like all this images used on the site they were taken by myself.

1. Page heading
2. Image carousel

4. Other Services

#### 1 - Page Heading
![images](docs/features/feature-projects-heading.png)

I wanted to make it easy for every user to know which page of the site they are on at all times.

I found that adding a heading to every page was the best way to do this.

#### 2 - Image Carousel
![images](docs/features/feature-projects-carousel.png)

For this section I used the carousel component from Bootstrap as a way to give the users a taste of the work with their relevant project titles as the caption.

Like all this images used on the site they were taken by myself.


#### 3 - Accordian
![images](docs/features/feature-projects-accordian.png)

For this section I used the accordian component from Bootstrap as I wanted to keep the page design clean and simple, but not to lose any of the written content.

Each section contains information about one of the photographers projects.

#### 4 - Other Services
![images](docs/features/feature-projects-other-services.png)

This section lists other services which are offered by the photographer, as well as another link for the user to contact the photographer.

I designed this section using a grid from Bootstrap to keep it responsive. I decided to use simple images for each service, in order to make it easy to distinguish that they are all different types of services.

Like all this images used on the site they were taken by myself.

Like all this images used on the site it was taken by myself.

#### 2 - Contact Information
![images](docs/features/feature-contact-details.png)

I used Font Awesome icons alongside text to keep this section simple and easy to read.

I also decided to use a brighter colour to make the details stand out from the page.

#### 3 - Form
![images](docs/features/feature-contact-form.png)

The form is fully responsive and uses the POST method. It gives users a simple way to contact the photographer directly.
