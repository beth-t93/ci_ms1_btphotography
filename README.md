### User Requirements and Expectations

- Easy way to contact the photographer
- Clean design that allows the images to be the main attraction to the website

#### Expectations
- The navigation links take you to the page they say they will

- Lots of images to showcase the photographers work

## Design Choices
The style of the site will be simple and minimal in order to let the photographs themselves do the work to attract users, however the website will still be accessible and easy to navigate.

### Colors
The colour scheme from this website comes from the photographers work, they make their best work while outside exploring the landscape. The colours will work together in a way that lets the images stand out, while also providing a neutral backdrop to view the photographs on.

![images](docs/features/colour-scheme.jpg)

I have chosen a colour scheme that is neutral with a single pop of colour.
 -Colour 1: (Hex: E8EDDF) is an off white color and will be used for body text, the logo and navigation.
 -Colour 2: (Hex: F5CB5C) is a shad of yellow which will be used in the icon of the logo alongside the off white. It will also be used for headings and call to action buttons
 -Colour 3: (Hex: 242423) is a grey/balck that will be used as the background colour to allow the photographs to be seen true to colour and allow them to stand out from the page.
 -Colour 4: (Hex: 333533) is a lighter grey that will be used to show any layout components, such as the footer, and in the grid components to seperate information into smaller sections.

### Fonts/Typography
To ensure the website is easily readable while also keeping to the simple and minimal design, the fonts used are: Ubuntu for headings and Fira Sans for all other text (these are taken from Google Fonts library) with sans-serif being the fallback font should either of the selected fonts be unavailable. 

### Imagery
All images on the website are taken by the photographer themselves and are high quality. The images give the viewer a taste of how the photographer works.

## Structure
A four page structured site that uses a combination of images and text.
